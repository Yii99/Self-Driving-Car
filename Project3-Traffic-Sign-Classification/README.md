## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, we need to train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, we need to try out the model on new images of German traffic signs which are found on the web.

Project Structure

- **[Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb):** Jupyter notebook containing the development of the CNN model and results.
- **[Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html):** Output of the Jupyter notebook as a html file.
- **[writeup.md](./writeup.md):** Writeup of the implementation describing the steps and the results


Project Goal
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report


Dependencies
---
This lab requires:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV
* TensorFlow 1.X
